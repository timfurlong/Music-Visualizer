# Tim's Music Visualizer #
This is a visualizer of the standard input represented as a number of waveforms. Each waveform cooresponds to a different frequency range. 

This project was done on my own (very limited) time, and therefor updates to this code rarely occur. If you have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to email me at furlong.tim@gmail.com.
